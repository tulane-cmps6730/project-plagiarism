Our project  is (or attempted to be) a cutting-edge Reddit Post Generator that can produce subreddit-specific posts that are indistinguishable from those created by actual Reddit users. Our goal is to provide a seamless and engaging user experience by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The Ambitious Goals we had -
- Develop a Reddit Post Generator capable of mimicking subreddit-specific styles and content.
- Enhance user engagement by generating  relevant and stylistically coherent posts.
- Push the boundaries of NLP technology to create more immersive and authentic user experiences in online communities.

The Methods we used- 

- Utilize the ALL POWERFUL Mistral 7B language model fine-tuned on a curated dataset of ten distinct, text-based subreddits.
- Experiment with prompt-based and text completion-based generation methods to optimize style emulation.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using BLEU scores and human assessments to gauge style accuracy.

Look no further for laughs , nonsensical jokes and sometimes not politically correct statements. Only the brave enter !!!
